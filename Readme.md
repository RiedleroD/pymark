# PyMark

Is a simple tool to compare the performance of various expressions in python.

## Installation

Currently, the only way to run this script is to install the proper development modules & run it directly from source.  
You'll need to have certain python versions for certain features, though the current minimum target is 3.6. Open an issue if it doesn't work for your version please.

### Linux

You'll need the python packages `pygobject` and `matplotlib` from pip or your preferred package manager. You'll also have to have proper gtk3 support. [The `pyobject` documentation](https://pygobject.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html) provides steps for setting up `gtk3` and `pyobject` for python on a variety of different distributions.

### Windows

The same as Linux, but you can only install through pip & getting gtk3 support is way harder.

[The `pyobject` documentation](https://pygobject.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html#windows-getting-started) provides a few simple steps to get `gtk3` and `pyobject` working on windows. Finally, `matplotlib` can be installed via pip (e.g. `<path-to-python-executable> -m pip install matplotlib`).

## Usage

I think everything is self-explanatory, but you know how UI and users are. If something is unclear, please open an issue or ask me somewhere else.

## Bugs & Feature requests

If you find a bug or have any feature request, please open an issue if there is not already one for your specific request.

## Contributing

If you want to contribute code, just open a pull request. I'm pretty chill, and my standards are pretty low, so I'm sure it'll get accepted right away.
